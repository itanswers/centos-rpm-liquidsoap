%description
Liquidsoap is a powerful and flexible language for describing your streams. It offers a rich collection of
operators that you can combine at will, giving you more power than you need for creating or transforming
streams. But liquidsoap is still very light and easy to use, in the Unix tradition of simple strong
components working together.
